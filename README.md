# Hello, My name is Bella 


I am a graduate student at National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan, majoring in Computer Science in Institute of Institute of Information Systems and Applications. I focus on analyzing massive datasets, building deep learning models, and contributing to the development of data-driven health systems. I’m particularly passionate about the intersection of human language and technology—especially in the fields of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs).

With a background that blends computer science and an interest in cognitive psychology, I approach my projects from a multidisciplinary perspective. I'm especially fascinated by how language shapes human thought and interaction, and how we can design intelligent systems that enhance human capabilities rather than replace them.

Outside of academics, I find balance through yoga, and I love exploring new places and cuisines. Whether it’s a hidden food stall or a local market abroad, I’m always up for a good food trip.
