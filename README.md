I am a graduate student with a passion for building intelligent, human-centered technologies. My academic and research work focuses on **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, and **Deep Learning**, particularly applied in the context of digital health and cognitive systems. With a strong foundation in data science and full-stack development, I aim to bridge the gap between machine learning theory and impactful, real-world applications.

My interdisciplinary background‚Äîspanning computer science, data analytics, and cognitive psychology‚Äîenables me to design systems that are both technically sound and socially aware. I believe in building technologies that **enhance human capability**, not replace it.

When I'm not coding or researching, you'll likely find me practicing yoga, reading about cognitive science, or exploring new cultures through their food.
